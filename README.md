# Module-11-Challenge-Web-Scraping

In this challenge, I scraped the Mars news website and analyzed the data by identifying HTML elements on a page by their id and class attributes, and used these elements to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. 

I have provided the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
